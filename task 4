1.for the given json iterate over all for loops (for, forin, forof, foreach):

i) "for() loop":

The For Loop comes first because of its simplicity and ease of use. 
It is a very user-friendly kind of loop that runs with a method of using a counter. 

The value is first set with an appropriate condition, which is also called ‘initializing a loop’. 
Next, the terminal or final value is specified. 
The For Loop makes things really easy when you need to run a set of codes multiple times.

Example:
let array = [10,20,30,40,50]
for(i=0;i<array.length;i++)
{
console.log(array[i]);
}

ii) "forin()" loop :


Another way of looping is the For In Loop. 
Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. 
So this makes the whole process even more simple and hassle-free. 
In fact, the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop.

The following are different ways of looping using the For In technique.

a. Looping through an Object Property

Here’s an example; you’ve got an object containing some properties and you need to look up each property and the value that it carries. 
Here’s how you would use the For In Loop to do so:

var person = {
   fname: "Nick",
   lname: "Jonas",
   age: 26
}; 
for (let x in person) {
   console.log(x + ": "+ person[x])
}


b. Looping Using JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. 
It’s a light format for storing and transferring data from one place to another. 
So in looping, it is one of the most commonly used techniques for 
	transporting data that is the array format or in attribute values. 

Here’s an example that demonstrates the above concept


var json = {
   one: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
   two: [21, 22, 23],
   three: [31, 32]
}
};
for(var key in json.jsonData) {
   for (var key1 in json.jsonData[key]) {
       console.log(json.jsonData[key][key1])
   }
}
‍
JSON Explained

If we go further in depth, there are a few more things you need to know about JSON.  
The code that we just ran can also be expressed by including ‘[]’ to contain the above three nodes.

var json = {
   jsonData:  [
       {one: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]},
       {two: [21, 22, 23]},
       {three: [31, 32]}
   ]
}; 
for (var i=0; i<json.jsonData.length; i++) {
   for (var key in json.jsonData[i]) {
       for (var j= 0; j<json.jsonData[i][key].length; j++) {
           console.log(json.jsonData[i][key][j])
       }
   }
}


iii) "ForEach()" Loop :

This method is used for looping through an array element. Here’s an example of this:

var names = ["jerry", "tom", "pluto", "micky", "mini"];
names.forEach(function1);
function function1(currentValue, index) {
   console.log("Index in array is: "+index + " ::  Value is: "+currentValue);
}
‍

iv) The For Of() Loop :

The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:

Syntax

for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}

Example: 

const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}
